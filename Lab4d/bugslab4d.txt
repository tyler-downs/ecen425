When run at t=10000, the code works fine.
But when run at t=750, the following output is displayed:
	Task A started.
	Task A, delaying 2.
	Task B started. 
	Task B, delaying 3.
	Task C started.
	Task C, delaying 5.
	Entering idle task.
The program enters the idle task because the tick handler is called
during the creation of Task D. The scheduler is then called, and since
tasks A, B and C are in the suspended list, only the idle task is available. 
The program then enters the idle task, but it never exits this task because
tick interrupts no longer happen. This is all before YKRun is even called.

I wonder if interrupts are supposed to be enabled at all before YKRun() is
called...
