-We had a bug with our typedef enums. With this compiler we had to take off the typedef part, and when we wanted to use that enum elsewhere in the code we had to use the word enum.

-When I try to run createTCB, I get an error that says I'm doing an illegal conversion from
pointer to long... but sometimes it lets me compile and run the code. The problem
seems to arise when I try to put more than one thing into the linked list. 10/12/2017 00:25
