Lab 6

A bug we had was we were missing tick number -1. This was a simple fix of running the Tick Handler (which increments YKTickNum) before putting the messages on the queue in the tick interrupt handler.

We were getting messages that we were missing ticks after the initial 7 were correctly read. We determined that when YKQPend was delaying a task and calling the scheduler, on return it did not pop a message off the queue and return it. After fixing that it worked great.


The lab took us about 5 hours.
