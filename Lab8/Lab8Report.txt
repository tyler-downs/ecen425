****** Lab 8 Report: ECEn 425 Fall 2017 *******
Tyler Downs, Bond Denhalter

We followed the basic algorithm outlined on the assignment
webpage. We ran into the following bugs:

1) We weren't checking correctly for if each bin was flat or
not. This caused pieces to go into the wrong bins.

2) We weren't rotating certain pieces, due to not covering
all cases.

3) Every time we put a corner piece down, we would increment the 
height of the bin, even if this corner piece stacked on top of and
was flush with another corner piece. This caused the program to think
the bins were higher than they actually were.
